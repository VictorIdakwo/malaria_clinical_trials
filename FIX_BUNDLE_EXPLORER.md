# Fix Bundle Resource Explorer

## Your Status: Bundle is VALID ✅

The validation script confirms:
- ✅ databricks.yml exists and is properly configured
- ✅ resources/jobs.yml exists with all job definitions  
- ✅ All 5 notebooks are present
- ✅ Training data CSV is present

**The bundle IS working** - VS Code just isn't displaying it.

## Solution: 3 Methods to Deploy

### Method 1: Reload VS Code (Quickest)

1. **Press**: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. **Type**: `Developer: Reload Window`
3. **Press**: Enter
4. **Wait**: 10-15 seconds for extension to reload
5. **Check**: Bundle Resource Explorer sidebar

### Method 2: Deploy via Command Palette (Recommended)

Don't wait for the explorer - deploy directly:

1. **Press**: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. **Type**: `Databricks: Deploy Bundle`
3. **Select**: `dev` (target environment)
4. **Watch**: Output panel for deployment progress

Expected output:
```
Validating bundle...
Uploading files...
Creating jobs...
✅ Deployment successful!
```

### Method 3: Configure Databricks Extension

If still not showing:

1. **Press**: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. **Type**: `Databricks: Configure`
3. **Set**:
   - Workspace: `https://1233387161743825.5.gcp.databricks.com`
   - Profile: `DEFAULT` or `epidemia_2`
4. **Reload**: Window again

## Verify Deployment

### In VS Code Output Panel:
Look for:
```
[info] deploy: Uploading bundle files...
[info] deploy: Creating jobs...
[info] deploy: ✅ Deployment complete
```

### In Databricks Web UI:

1. Go to: https://1233387161743825.5.gcp.databricks.com
2. Click **Workflows** → **Jobs**
3. You should see:
   - `Malaria_RL_Training_dev`
   - `Malaria_Model_Evaluation_dev`

---

## Why Bundle Explorer is Empty

Common reasons:
1. **VS Code cache** - Fixed by reload
2. **Extension not fully loaded** - Wait 15 seconds after open
3. **Wrong folder open** - Must open `Clinical_Reinforcement_learning` folder
4. **Extension needs configuration** - Set workspace in settings

None of these affect actual deployment!

---

## Quick Deploy Command

If VS Code isn't cooperating, deploy from PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\victor.idakwo\Documents\ehealth Africa\ehealth Africa\eHA GitHub\Mian Disease Modelling\Malaria\Clinical_Reinforcement_learning"

# If you have new CLI installed:
databricks bundle deploy --target dev

# Or use VS Code Command Palette (recommended)
```

---

## What to Do NOW

### Option A: Just Deploy It! (Recommended)
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type: `Databricks: Deploy Bundle`
3. Select `dev`
4. ✅ Done!

### Option B: Fix Explorer First
1. Reload VS Code window
2. Wait 15 seconds
3. Check Bundle Explorer
4. Then deploy

---

## After Deployment

Once deployed (via any method), verify in Databricks:

1. **Check Jobs Created**:
   - Workflows → Jobs
   - Should see 2 jobs

2. **Check Notebooks Uploaded**:
   - Workspace → Your folder
   - Should see 5 notebooks

3. **Run Initial Setup**:
   - Open `01_data_preparation.py` in Databricks
   - Attach to cluster
   - Run all cells

---

## Summary

✅ Your bundle IS working
✅ Files are all present
✅ Configuration is valid
❌ VS Code explorer just needs refresh

**Solution**: Use Command Palette to deploy directly!

**Deploy NOW**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Databricks: Deploy Bundle` → `dev`
